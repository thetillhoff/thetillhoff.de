## Business value vs sustainability & nature in general
So what many businesses are saying is "we cannot cut down our usage of unsustainable resources, because it would reduce the growth/value of the company (in contrast to competitors)".

But where did all those companies get their value from in the first place? Directly or indirectly from nature, that's where.

So if you argue that "going green" must stand behind business value and growth, what you're actually saying is that your company is more important than a livable earth.
That extracting as much money from nature for you or someone else right now is more important than providing for your children and grandchildren.
What are you working so hard for exactly again?

Or, as a CEO got ensured by their board (sadly, I cannot remember where I read that) when making an ethically correct decision that earned the company less money in as the competitor: "We hired you to make the most money safely." - IIRC in that story, their competition got found out and the company got an influx of customers soon after.
