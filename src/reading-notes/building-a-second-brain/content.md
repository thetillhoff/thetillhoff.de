# Building A Second Brain - A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential
By Tiago Forte

Opening funfact: Human brains process 34GB of information every day

## C - Capture
- Capture the right things
- Capture to one place only
- Export/integration must exist (no lock-in)
- Potent & urgent things only, only the two key takeaways per day on average
- Don't organize immediately, but at a later point in time. That makes your going over more analytical

## O - Organize
- The environment matters for inspired thinking -> focus time&place
- Don't sort by subject like a library, but sort like in a kitchen. Efficiency and process optimization matters -> Intuitive
- Projects - the domains of second brain projects often have deadlines
- Areas - Topics
- Resources - Interesting, but no goal (yet)
- Archives - finished or irrelevant

## D - Distill
- Getting more knowledge means adding information, getting wisdom means subtracting information
- Distill is about subtracting
- First iteration is to summarize == only relevant parts remain, like  for an executive summary

## E - Express
- Knowledge assets like lego bricks, software modules, movie scenes, ...
- "Intermediate packages" with which you can use to get fast & early feedback
- Examples like vision, agenda, mission statement
- Rephrasing things is helpful but not perfect. You need to use the knowledge to really grasp its meaning.

Only start projects where you did already 80% of the research. Then you're more likely to finish them.
