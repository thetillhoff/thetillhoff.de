# Deep work - Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
By Cal Newport

- Don't multitask.
  1+1 isn't 2, because there's overhead for context switching.
- Finish tasks before moving to the next.
- Don't schedule breaks from distractions, but breaks from focus.
- Find a way to incorporate focus time into your routine. It's doesn't matter how, but it has to be intentional & conscious.
- Establish a ritual to get into focus mode. Examples:
  - Special place/space.
  - Boundaries, like staying offline.
- Give your body what it needs to be productive in a sustainable way like
  - sport
  - food
  - water
- Take unproductive brain time like showering to think about a problem, and about action questions aka how to reach the solution you found.
- Prefer real time with friends over online communication -> higher value, for the relationship, and also less mental strain.
- (Occasionally) track and schedule 30min blocks of what you're doing on a day to raise awareness where your time goes.
- Stay sustainable: Don't check work messages like mails on weekends.
- If a work day feels unproductive, leave your phone off/line (-> it's about the notifications & distractions) and set specific time slots where you allow yourself to use the internet.
