# Getting Things Done - The Art of Stress-Free Productivity
By David Allen

## How to stop thinking about things you have to keep track of
- To stop them from taking space in your mind, topics have to be collected somewhere outside -> collection tool.
  Else, they are constantly pulling on your mind and distracting your thoughts.
- For each topic you're noting down, clarify the exact next step/s aka physical action you have to take.
- Find a system for reminders that works for you.
-> You noted down the next task and your reminder system will tell you when it's time.

## 
- "Knowledge work" - office work - is about defining a goal or next step, not about doing it.
  Thinking about the expected result is a key for that.
  There's no perfect answer to most choices, it's about risks and options and decisions
- Thinking about the next steps is rarely needed - think about school, work or career.

- Things are on our minds because they aren't as they should be
- Todo lists should define desired outcome and next steps/, not just topics
-> rule of thumb: add a verb to the points on Todo lists

"Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it substitutes for action" - Bill Raeder
-> This is also true for discussions and meetings

-> Tools like Jira & Co are also Todo lists in a way. Tasks in there have to be actionable.
