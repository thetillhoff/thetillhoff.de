# Why feedback is important

To grow, evolve & improve yourself, you need to identify growth areas. But here's the problem: you don't know what you don't know.

Without feedback, your growth is limited to the speed at which you discover new things on your own. You can only improve in areas you're already aware of.

Feedback changes this. It helps you grow faster by having others identify growth areas you didn't know existed. When done well, it even provides specific suggestions on how to improve.

## Building trust and openness

Feedback also gives people around you the chance to address issues you might not be aware of. Asking for feedback signals that you're open to change. It shows you know you're not perfect, and you're willing to improve.

This builds trust and respect. It invites others to do the same, which in turn helps them grow, evolve & improve themselves. Since every human is different, this creates a growing diversity of knowledge, making identification of growth areas more likely.

## Leveraging collective wisdom

What you're actually doing by asking for feedback is leveraging others' accumulated knowledge and experience to identify how you can grow. You're tapping into perspectives and insights you couldn't access on your own.

## The multiplier effect

If you have a feedback culture, everyone is distributing the potential of their growth to all their peers.

And here's the catch: distributing the potential of growth doesn't mean you get the average of all your peers — you get the sum of all.

Isn't that a beautiful thing?
