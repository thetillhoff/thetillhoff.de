All things can be broken down to efficiency.

- cooking and eating, be it fast food, restaurant or home-cooked
- many things are about having made experiences
- inspiration helps efficiency, too
- quality
- speed
- more features - efficiency on customer side
- teaching others - efficiency in the long run
