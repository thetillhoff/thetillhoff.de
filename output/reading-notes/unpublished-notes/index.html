        Business value vs sustainability &amp; nature in general
      </h2>
      <p>
        So what many businesses are saying is &quot;we cannot cut down our usage of unsustainable resources, because it would reduce the growth/value of the company (in contrast to competitors)&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        But where did all those companies get their value from in the first place? Directly or indirectly from nature, that's where.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you argue that &quot;going green&quot; must stand behind business value and growth, what you're actually saying is that your company is more important than a livable earth.
        <br>
        That extracting as much money from nature for you or someone else right now is more important than providing for your children and grandchildren.
        <br>
        What are you working so hard for exactly again?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Or, as a CEO got ensured by their board (sadly, I cannot remember where I read that) when making an ethically correct decision that earned the company less money in as the competitor: &quot;We hired you to make the most money safely.&quot; - IIRC in that story, their competition got found out and the company got an influx of customers soon after.
