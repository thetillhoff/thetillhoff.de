        How to stop thinking about things you have to keep track of
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To stop them from taking space in your mind, topics have to be collected somewhere outside -&gt; collection tool.
          <br>
          Else, they are constantly pulling on your mind and distracting your thoughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each topic you're noting down, clarify the exact next step/s aka physical action you have to take.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find a system for reminders that works for you.
          <br>
          -&gt; You noted down the next task and your reminder system will tell you when it's time.
        </li>
      </ul>

          <p>
            &quot;Knowledge work&quot; - office work - is about defining a goal or next step, not about doing it.
            <br>
            Thinking about the expected result is a key for that.
            <br>
            There's no perfect answer to most choices, it's about risks and options and decisions
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Thinking about the next steps is rarely needed - think about school, work or career.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Things are on our minds because they aren't as they should be
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Todo lists should define desired outcome and next steps/, not just topics
            <br>
            -&gt; rule of thumb: add a verb to the points on Todo lists
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Thought is useful when it motivates action and a hindrance when it substitutes for action&quot; - Bill Raeder
        <br>
        -&gt; This is also true for discussions and meetings
      </p>
      <p>
        -&gt; Tools like Jira &amp; Co are also Todo lists in a way. Tasks in there have to be actionable.
