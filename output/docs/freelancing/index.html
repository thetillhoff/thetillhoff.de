        Use multiple approaches together, like have your own website/portfolio, freelancing platforms, social media, contact companies, apply at "Personaldienstleister" and it-/consulting companies

        "Personaldienstleister" want to fill gaps in their provided services, as to consultancies
        Also, for short-term projects that need special skills, freelancers are better than hiring long-term for consultancies
